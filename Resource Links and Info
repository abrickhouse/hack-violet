		Problems with PPE for women - Personal Protective Equipment like face masks, gloves, and hard hats are designed for the male body, which differs greatly from a female body. The safety statistics given by PPE manufacturers are often inaccurate, and lower for women. Rarely is equipment, like life vests, made for pregnant bodies.

		Problems in tech: (maybe list early since the judges would care about this field)
			Google's speech recognition has a gender bias - Automatic speech recognition systems make more errors for Black speakers than white speakers. There's a 70% chance transcriptions for a man will be more accurate than for a woman.
