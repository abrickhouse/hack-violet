      <h1 class="display-1">Eating Disorders</h1>
      <p id="header-p">
        Eating disorders are a range of psychological conditions that cause
        unhealthy eating habits to develop. They might start with an obsession
        with food, body weight, or body shape. In severe cases, eating disorders
        can cause serious health consequences and may even result in death if
        left untreated. Those with eating disorders can have a variety of
        symptoms. However, most include the severe restriction of food, food
        binges, or purging behaviors like vomiting or over-exercising.

        <h1 class="display-6">Anorexia Nervosa</h1>
        <p>
          People with anorexia generally view themselves as overweight, even if
          they’re dangerously underweight. They tend to constantly monitor their
          weight, avoid eating certain types of foods, and severely restrict
          their calories. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms are also often present.
          For instance, many people with anorexia are often preoccupied with
          constant thoughts about food, and some may obsessively collect recipes
          or hoard food.
        </p>
        <h1 class="display-6">Bulimia Nervosa</h1>
        <p>
          People with bulimia frequently eat unusually large amounts of food in
          a specific period of time. Each binge eating episode usually continues
          until the person becomes painfully full. During a binge, the person
          usually feels that they cannot stop eating or control how much they
          are eating. Binges can happen with any type of food but most commonly
          occur with foods the individual would normally avoid. Individuals with
          bulimia then attempt to purge to compensate for the calories consumed
          and relieve gut discomfort. Common purging behaviors include forced
          vomiting, fasting, laxatives, diuretics, enemas, and excessive
          exercise.
        </p>
        <h1 class="display-6">Binge Eating Disorder</h1>
        <p>
          Binge eating disorder is believed to be one of the most common eating
          disorders, especially in the United States. It typically begins during
          adolescence and early adulthood, although it can develop later on.
          They typically eat unusually large amounts of food in relatively short
          periods of time and feel a lack of control during binges. People with
          binge eating disorder do not restrict calories or use purging
          behaviors, such as vomiting or excessive exercise, to compensate for
          their binges.
        </p>
        <h1 class="display-6">Pica</h1>
        <p>
          Individuals with pica crave non-food substances, such as ice, dirt,
          soil, chalk, soap, paper, hair, cloth, wool, pebbles, laundry
          detergent, or cornstarch. Pica can occur in adults, as well as
          children and adolescents. That said, this disorder is most frequently
          observed in children, pregnant women, and individuals with mental
          disabilities. Individuals with pica may be at an increased risk of
          poisoning, infections, gut injuries, and nutritional deficiencies.
          Depending on the substances ingested, pica may be fatal.
        </p>
        <h1 class="display-6">Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder</h1>
        <p>
          Although ARFID generally develops during infancy or early childhood,
          it can persist into adulthood. What’s more, it’s equally common among
          men and women. Individuals with this disorder experience disturbed
          eating either due to a lack of interest in eating or distaste for
          certain smells, tastes, colors, textures, or temperatures.
