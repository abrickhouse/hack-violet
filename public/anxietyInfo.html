      <h1 class="display-1">Anxiety</h1>
      <p id="header-p">
        Anxiety is a normal response to stress. But when it becomes hard to
        control and affects your day-to-day life, it can be disabling. Anxiety
        disorders affect nearly 1 in 5 adults in the United States. Women are
        more than twice as likely as men to get an anxiety disorder in their
        lifetime. Anxiety disorders are often treated with counseling, medicine,
        or a combination of both. Some women also find that yoga or meditation
        helps with anxiety disorders.

        <h1 class="display-6">Generalized Anxiety Disorder</h1>
        <p>
          Generalized Anxiety Disorder, GAD, is an anxiety disorder
          characterized by chronic anxiety, exaggerated worry and tension, even
          when there is little or nothing to provoke it.
        </p>
        <h4 class="display-6">Panic Disorder</h4>
        <p>
          Panic disorder is an anxiety disorder and is characterized by
          unexpected and repeated episodes of intense fear accompanied by
          physical symptoms that may include chest pain, heart palpitations,
          shortness of breath, dizziness, or abdominal distress.
        </p>
        <h4 class="display-6">Social Anxiety Disorder</h4>
        <p>
          Social Phobia, or Social Anxiety Disorder, is an anxiety disorder
          characterized by overwhelming anxiety and excessive self-consciousness
          in everyday social situations. Social phobia can be limited to only
          one type of situation - such as a fear of speaking in formal or
          informal situations, or eating or drinking in front of others - or, in
          its most severe form, may be so broad that a person experiences
          symptoms almost anytime they are around other people.
        </p>
        <h4 class="display-6">Post Traunmatic Stress Disorder</h4>
        <p>
          Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, PTSD, is an anxiety disorder that can
          develop after exposure to a terrifying event or ordeal in which grave
          physical harm occurred or was threatened. Traumatic events that may
          trigger PTSD include violent personal assaults, natural or
          human-caused disasters, accidents, or military combat.

              The referral service is free of charge. If you have no insurance

              we can often refer you to facilities that charge on a sliding fee
              scale or accept Medicare or Medicaid. If you have health
              insurance, you are encouraged to contact your insurer for a list
