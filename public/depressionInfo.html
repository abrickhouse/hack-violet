     <h1 class="display-1">Depression</h1>
     <p id="header-p">
       Women are more prone to psychological causes of depression than men.
       With a tendency to be more emotional, women are more likely to rehash negative
       thoughts during bouts of depression. While it is a normal response to cry, talk with
       friends, and rehash why it is you are in your depressive state, research has shown
       that ruminating about depression can cause it to last longer and even make it worse.
        Additional psychological factors that
       tend to affect women over men are negative body images and stress-induced depression.
       Women are more prone to stress than men because their increased levels of progesterone
       have been shown to prevent stress hormones from leveling out. Negative body image issues
       usually begin in adolescence and seem to be correlated with the onset of puberty in women.

       <h1 class="display-6">Major Depressive Disorder</h1>
       <p>
         Major depression is a severe form of depression where a woman loses
         her ability to find pleasure in activities once considered enjoyable.
         In addition, it affects a woman’s ability to work, sleep, and eat in
         normal and effective manners and usually negatively impacts
         interpersonal and social relationships. With major depression, also
         known as major depressive disorder, your depressed state may persist
         for an extended period of time and is often accompanied with low
         self-esteem.
       </p>
       <h1 class="display-6">Postpartum Depression</h1>
       <p>
         This is a special form of depression that occurs after the birth of a
         baby – often referred to as the “baby blues.” Typical symptoms of
         depression begin in the months following birth, while in some women,
         they can occur while still pregnant.
       </p>
       <h1 class="display-6">Persistent Depressive Disorder</h1>
       <p>
         Considered a milder form of depression, this is an extended depressed
         mood that lasts for two years or more. Major depressive episodes
         (i.e., more severe forms of depression) may still occur during
         persistent depressive disorder.
       </p>
       <h1 class="display-6">Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder</h1>
       <p>
         Depression that is tied to a woman’s menstrual cycle. In this form of
         depression, severe mood swings, anxiety, and negative thoughts present
         themselves in the week prior to the start of menstruation and
         dissipate once the menstrual period begins. Depressive symptoms are
         severe enough to negatively impact interpersonal relationships and
         interfere with daily activities.

           <h1 class="display-6">
           Some of the distinguishing factors in how depression differs between
           women vs. men include:</h1>
         Women feel anxious and scared while men feel guarded. Women blame
         themselves for the depression; men blame others. Women commonly feel
         sad, worthless, and apathetic when depressed; men tend to feel
         irritable and angry. Women are more likely to avoid conflicts when
         depressed; men are more likely to create conflicts. Women turn to food
         and friends to self-medicate; men turn to alcohol, TV, sex, or sports.
         Women feel lethargic and nervous; men feel agitated and restless.
