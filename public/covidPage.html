        How COVID-19 impacted the general wellness of everyone in the world, and
        changed how we look at healthcare.

    <p id="VT">
      In the wake of COVID-19, millions have been left with not only physical
      health issues, but mental issues as well. It is our goal to help the world
      heal from this disaster by spreading awareness and affordable, accessible
      care.

    <h5 class="display-6">Problems with PPE for women</h5>
    <p id="VT">
      Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) like face masks, gloves, and hard hats
      are designed for the male body, which differs greatly from the female body.
      The safety statistics give by PPE manufacturers are often inaccurate, and
      less safe for women. Rarely is equipment, like life vests, made for pregnant
      bodies.

    <p id="VT">
      Many local regions are providing test kits for free to individuals through 
      libraries and other locations. This website is an example of how easy it is
      to receive supplies to help mitigate COVID-19 from the government.

    <h5 class="display-6">Get free at-home COVID-19 tests</h5>
    <p id="VT">
      You can order free at-home COVID-19 test kits to your address. It is important
      to note there have been issues with registering from an apartment
      builting that has multiple units. Additionally, this does not aid the 
      homeless community, which is one of the most at risk during the pandemic.
