        Women today... something about how healthcare focuses on how men display
        symptoms which causes women to get brushed off and underdiagnosed and/or
        misdiagnosed. We aim to provide a resource for women to find information

    <h5 class="display-6">Social Anxiety Disorder</h5>
    <p id="VT">
      Social Phobia, or Social Anxiety Disorder, is an anxiety disorder
      characterized by overwhelming anxiety and excessive self-consciousness in
      everyday social situations. Social phobia can be limited to only one type
      of situation - such as a fear of speaking in formal or informal
      situations, or eating or drinking in front of others - or, in its most
      severe form, may be so broad that a person experiences symptoms almost
      anytime they are around other people.
    </p>
    <h5 class="display-6">Post Traunmatic Stress Disorder</h5>
    <p id="VT">
      Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, PTSD, is an anxiety disorder that can
      develop after exposure to a terrifying event or ordeal in which grave
      physical harm occurred or was threatened. Traumatic events that may
      trigger PTSD include violent personal assaults, natural or human-caused
      disasters, accidents, or military combat.
