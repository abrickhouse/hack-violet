# This is a hackathon project created for HackViolet, February 2022.
# Our project, Women's Health Hub, provides information about mental health 
# and disparities in healthcare for women. Our goal is to provide factual
# and understandable resources for women to take agency in their health.
# The website has many links to resources across a wide range of topics.
# There is a chatbot feature that aids users in finding pages relevant to
# their needs. There is a newsletter sign up feature for users to receive
# information about their interests and information that relates to them
# like national policy. 

# The most complete resource pages to look at are vTech.html, genR.html, 
# covidPage.html
# The most complete facts pages to look at are are anxietyInfo.html, 
# edInfo.html, and depressionInfo.html
